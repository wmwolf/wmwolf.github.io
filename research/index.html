    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I am interested in stellar structure and evolution-- how stars live and die. In particular, I make computer models of classical and recurrent novae, which are the thermonuclear runways that result from this accretion. I then use these models to predict and explain observations of these events, dozens of which are detected every year.
    </p>
    <div class='d-md-none d-lg-block'>
      <p>
        Novae are a common event in the universe, and their prodigious luminositities, at tens or hundreds of thousands of times greater than that of our sun, make them visible in other galaxies. They are important in the chemical evolution of the galaxies, and they may be an important stepping stone in the path to type Ia supernovae, which are violent explosions that created half of the iron in your body.

        <h2>What I Study</h2>
        <p>
          Most generally, I study theoretical astrophysics. More specifically,
          I study the endstates of stars, primarily in the form of accreting
          white dwafs and supernovae, both of which you can learn about
          in the tabs above.

        <h4>Tools I Use</h4>
        <p>
          I am primarily a theorist, so my main tools are computational. I use
          the open-source stellar evolution code,
          <a href="http://mesa.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">
            MESA
          </a>
          which was largely developed here at UCSB, specifically by 
          <a href="http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/members/PM/paxton/" target="_blank">
            Bill Paxton
          </a>
          of the KITP, though the community is continually growing as more and
          more astronomers help to develop the code. I use MESA to model
          various stellar configurations to try to explain and predict
          observations in the night sky.
        </p> 
        <p>
          In the process of working with simulation data from MESA, I use many
          other computational tools to aid me, including several I have written
          myself that you can learn about
          <a href="/projects" target="_blank">
            here<!--
       --><!--</a>. Other useful tools I use are the python tools 
          <a href="http://www.numpy.org" target="_blank"> Numpy </a>,
          <a href="http://www.scipy.org" target="_blank"> Scipy </a>, and
          <a href="http://matplotlib.org" target="_blank"> matplotlib </a>
          for numerical and plotting tasks. For more astro-specific needs, I 
          use the wonderful <a href="http://www.astropy.org" target="_blank">
          astropy </a> module. For other projects I have used the radiative
          transfer code <a href="http://nublado.org" target="_blank">Cloudy</a>,
          which is another open source project for astronomers, and I also
          still use Bill Paxton and Vincent Fourmond's lovely plotting tool

        <h2>Accreting White Dwarfs</h2>
        <p>
          My primary research while at UCSB has been on the various ways white
          dwarf stars react when they accrete matter from a companion. A large
          fraction (roughly one third) of stars form in binary systems. As a result,
          a star's binary companion can affect its evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a star that's not too massive (perhaps up to several times the mass
          of the sun) runs out of nuclear fuel, it sheds its outer layers, leaving
          behind a very hot, earth-sized object called a white dwarf that is
          of such tremendous density that the primary pressure preventing it from
          further collapse is that from electron's wave functions not wanting to
          overlap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if a white dwarf has a binary companion, it is possible that due to
          the winds or just a spillover of material from expansion as it evolves,
          the compaion can donate matter onto the surface of the white dwarf, either
          by direct accretion or more likely through an accretion disk. What happens
          to that matter once it makes its way to the surface of the white dwarf
          depends on the mass of the white dwarf, the composition of the material,
          and the temperature of the white dwarf. These outcomes are the primary
          focus of my research.
        </p>
        <h4>Outcome 1: Steady Burner</h4>
        <p>
          For a given mass white dwarf accreting solar-like material from a
          compaion, there is a narrow range of accretion rates that allow for the
          material to be burned at the same rate it is being accreted. In such a
          configuration, The matter can be thought to arrive at the surface of the
          white dwarf, pass through a thin (~10<sup>-7</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>)
          hydrogen-rich layer before reaching the burning layer, where it is
          processed into nearly pure helium at a temperature of around
          10<sup>8</sup> K. These steady-state burners are still compact objects, 
          but are prodigiously luminous, burning at nearly 10,000 times the 
          luminosity of the sun. As such, they are remarkably hot, with effective
          temperatures ranging from 100,000 K to 1,000,000 K. Being so hot, they 
          emit strongly in the ultraviolet and soft X-ray. This, along with their 
          original mode of discovery gives them their more common name, 
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersoft_x-ray_source'>
            supersoft sources
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          In my work, I have used the computational tool
          <a href='http://mesa.sourceforge.net'>MESA</a> to find the accretion rates
          that allow for this outcome as well as the resulting structure of thse
          objects. I continue to study them to understand what the fate of the 
          growing helium layer under the burning layer is as well as how that may
          affect the long-term mass growth or decay of the objects, as they are
          speculated to be one channel towards producing a 
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_Supernova'>
            Type Ia supernova
          </a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Outcome 2: Nova</h4>
        <p>
          If the accreting matter is too deficient in hydrogen or it is accreting
          too slowly, it arrives on the white dwarf cold and instead accumulates
          with little to no hydrogen burning. After a sufficiently large envelope
          has accumulated, the pressure at the base of the freshly accreted layer
          becomes high enough to initiate unstable burning that is much more
          vigorous than that in the steady burning case. This rapid injection of
          energy into the thin outer envelope drives a convective wave through the
          accumulated layer, which in turn drives the radius of the white dwarf
          to expand dramatically, cooling the outer layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this now engorged and highly luminous state, the white dwarf becomes
          about as luminous as the steady state burner, but since it is so much
          cooler, we can observe it easily with optical telescopes both in the 
          Milky Way and in nearby galaxies like M31. This state is a nova
          outburst, where the expanded white dwarf is bright in the optical and is
          typically observed to drive a wind, blowing off much of the material it
          had built up before it can be burned. After the envelope mass has been
          reduced by mass loss to a sufficiently small mass, it shrinks back down
          to a more supersoft source-like state, where it burns its remnant envelope
          quasi-stably for days to years before finally extinguishing and returning
          to its accreting state.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research concerning the nova outcome has focused on finding what 
          recurrence times (times between nova outbursts) arise from various 
          combinations of white dwarf mass and accretion rate of solar-like
          material. This is important since measuring a recurrence time of tens of
          years is typically assumed to indicate a massive white dwarf and a
          possible progenitor system for a type Ia supernova or accretion-induced
          collapse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally I've done extensive work characterizing the 
          supersoft phase of the nova after outburst, attempting to use
          measurements of this phase to constrain the progenitor system. Most
          recently, collaborators working with the 
          <a href="http://www.ptf.caltech.edu/iptf/">
            Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory
          </a>
          discovered and analyzed the quickest-recurring nova known, which goes off
          in M31 about once every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most recently I've been working with collaborators to better understand
          how the supersoft phase after outburst could affect the radio observations
          of novae long after their optical peak. This work is ongoing.

        <h2>Superluminous Supernovae</h2>
        <p>
          Supernovae are among the most luminous energy sources in the known
          universe, often outshining their host galaxies for days when they go
          off. They are also believed to be the primary generators of metals
          heavier than carbon in the universe, and 
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova"
            target="_blank">type Ia supernovae
          </a> can even be used as cosmic distance indicators, leading us to the
          discovery of dark energy.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Recently, though new classes of superluminous supernovae have
          emerged, challenging our current understanding of how stars die. One
          of my current projects is to search for these superluminous supernovae
          in the dataset from the 
          <a href="http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/SNLS/" target="_blank">
            Supernova Legacy Survey
          </a>
          (SNLS).
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine if a supernova can be deemed "superluminous", we need
          to have measured how bright we observe it to be as well as how far
          away it is. After all, two flashlights of the sam intrinsic brightness
          will appear to differ if viewed from different distances. To do that
          we use cosmic redshift, as first made famous by Edwin Hubble. The
          supernovae the SNLS observed are typically far enough away that 
          cosmic expansion is moving them away so fast that their emergent
          spectrum is reddened significantly, like how a receding train whistle
          sounds lower in pitch than it "actually" is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually finding a redshift (and thus getting a distance) is done by
          measuring a spectrum of an event. The SNLS was primarily interested
          in finding type Ia supernova for their cosmological purposes, so most
          events that would later be found to be superlumious super novae do not
          have spectra on record. In this case, we rely on the spectrum of their
          host galaxy to infer a redshift, and thus a distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have a useful redshift, we then model the supernova as an
          expanding fireball whose radius and temperature evolve with time
          according to
          
          $$R(t) = R_0 + v_{\mathrm{exp}}t$$
          $$T(t) = T_0 + \frac{dT}{dt}t$$
          
          so that the radius is expanding linearly with time and the temperature
          is assumed to decline linearly with time (dT/dt < 0). While this isn't
          a very robust model, it is often good enough to model the event at its
          peak brightness.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a full model light curve for the event, we can determine if it is
          superluminous or otherwise interesting. This work is ongoing.
