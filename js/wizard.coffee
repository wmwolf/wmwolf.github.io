### IMPORTANT GLOBAL VARIABLE ###
# This lists all the coures objects and is used in several classes, which
# is terrible form, but hey, it works! Well, usually... The order is important.
# When cycling through the courses, its best if prerequisites come before
# the courses they depend on. So math courses should always go first, and then
# mostly courses can simply increase in number. However, care must be taken to
# ensure that some MSE courses are in the right place. For instance, MSE 451
# depends on PHYS 333, but if it comes before PHYS 333, completing PHYS 333
# will not immediately cause PHYS 451 to be marked as available because it is
# refreshed *before* PHYS 333 since it's earlier on the list.

# Fall 2022: Removed PHYS 205, 361, 362, and 363
