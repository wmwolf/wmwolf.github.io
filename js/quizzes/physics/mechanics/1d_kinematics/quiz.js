Describe how the <span class='font-italic'>velocity</span> changes from the instant it left your hand to the instant just before it returns.",['It starts positive and decreases through zero and ends negative.','It is constant through the entire trajectory.','It rises initially until peak height, and then decreases.','It is always non-negative but decreasing.'],["Yes! You start the ball off with a positive (upwards) velocity initially, but gravity's constant pull causes it to slow down, stop mid-air, and then move downwards (negative velocity) back to your hand.",'Not quite... The velocity is how the position changes with time. If you took snapshots at equal time intervals, would the ball appear to move the same amount in the same direction between every pair of snapshots?','Hint: you might be thinking of the <span class="font-italic">position</span> rather than the <span class="font-italic">velocity</span>','Gravity does cause the velocity to decrease, but if the velocity is always non-negative, then the ball would always be moving upward (or at least never downwards).'],0));

It might be easier to think of velocity as an intermediate quantity that relates the two together.','Maybe think of the units. Every time we differentiate something with respect to time, the units of that quantity have on more time dimension. In SI, acceleration has units of m/s<sup>2</sup>.','Maybe think of the units. Every time we differentiate something with respect to time, the units of that quantity have on more time dimension. In SI, acceleration has units of m/s<sup>2</sup>.','Yes! Acceleration is the first derivative of velocity, which is in turn the first derivative of displacement, so acceleration is the second derivative of displacement.'],3));

The very first step of the derivation of the kinematic equations assumed constant acceleration.','No. Kinematics can account for changing velocities, like an object falling under the influence of uniform gravity.','No, there is at least one base assumption of the kinematic equations that, if violated, makes them incorrect.'],1));

Which of these is true of its acceleration and displacement?',['Acceleration is positive, displacement increasing','Acceleration is zero, displacement increasing','Acceleration is positive, displacement is constant','Acceleration is zero, displacement is constant'],['What is the relationship between acceleration and velocity? What does it mean for velocity to be constant?','Yes! A constant velocity means acceleration vanishes, but the positive velocity means that the object is constantly moving forward (or up, or whatever positive means).','What is the relationship between acceleration and velocity? What does it mean for velocity to be constant? Also, what does a non-zero velocity mean for the displacement?','A constant velocity does indeed mean the acceleration is zero, but what does a non-zero velocity mean for the displacement? The object is not at rest.'],1));

Does it make sense for a vector to "always be positive or negative"? Vectors are just pairs of values and directions. What is "negative" is determined by our coordinate system.','Close, it is a scalar, but we can be more precise.','Yes! Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. As such, it must <span class="font-italic">always</span> be non-negative. Not all scalars are non-negative, though. For example, temperature (in some scales) can be negative.'],3));
