<h4>About These Exercises</h4>
<p>
  These lab exercises will have you exploring the topic of massive star binaries using the <samp>binary</samp> module of <samp>MESA</samp>. This page will likely fall out of date as the interface of <samp>MESA</samp> changes in its development and the hyperlinks on this page become outdated.
  For greatest compatibility, you should use the following versions of <samp>MESA</samp> and the SDK:

<h4>Science Background</h4>
<p>
  Massive stars are important for many fields of astrophysics: they are thought to have provided most of the ionizing radiation that caused cosmic reionization, their remnants merge in gravitational wave events, and they even produced the oxygen we breathe. Understanding the evolution of massive stars is therefore a key component, for example, when interpreting the radiation from distant galaxies or estimating the merger rates of neutron stars.
</p>
<p>
  However, massive stars are not born alone. In fact, they spend their lives in so close of an orbit with at least one companion star that dramatic interaction is bound to happen as the stars evolve and swell. Through interaction, many solar masses of material can be exchanged between the two stars, X-rays can be produced, and the stars can even coalesce. In this lab, we will use MESA’s binary module to model a variety of interactions in massive binaries.
</p>

<h4>The Labs in Summary</h4>
<p>
  We have prepared three laboratory exercises that will familiarize you with how to use the <code>binary</code> module to model interacting binary stars, as well as some of the difficulties you might run into in the process.

<h4 id="part1b" class='mt-4'>Introduction to <code>MESA binary</code></h4>
<p>
  <code>MESA</code> has a <code>binary</code> module, which is very similar to the <code>star</code> module, but has the capability to evolve two stars simultaneously while also accounting for mass exchange between them. To accommodate both stars and the binary orbit, there is one inlist for the binary orbit (<code>inlist_project</code>) which points to one inlist for each of the stars (<code>inlist1</code>, <code>inlist2</code>). It is also possible to evolve just one of the stars in the system, while treating the other as a point mass, which can be handy when simulating systems composed of a star and a compact object. Similar to the <code>star</code> module, there is a <code>binary_history.data</code> output file which tracks information about the binary system while there still are the history.data and profile files for the individual components in their respective <code>LOGS1/2</code> folders. There is also a <code>run_binary_extras.f90</code> file in the <code>src</code> directory, for when you need to access the two stars at the same time or interact with parameters of the binary orbit. 
</p>
<!-- <p>
  The first minilab directory is not very different from the standard <code>binary</code> work directory located at <code>$MESA_DIR/binary/work</code>, much like its cousin from <code>star</code>. It has a very similar structure with a few key differences stemming from the fact that <code>binary</code> can model two stars simultaneously, which we'll call star 1 and star 2. While it models the two stars in sync, it also tracks data about the binary itself, such as orbital separation, orbital period, and mass transfer rates.

  Click through on some of the file names below. Most that look familiar from <code>star</code> have similar or identical functions in <code>binary</code>, but in some cases, like the multiple inlists and LOGS directories, are more nuanced.

<h4 id='part1c' class='mt-4'>Envelope Stripping with a Black Hole Companion</h4>
<p>
  About a third of all massive stars are expected to lose their hydrogen-rich envelopes either via mass transfer or the successful ejection of a common envelope. Here, we start exploring envelope-stripping via Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF, mass transfer) in a binary initially composed of a 14 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> star that orbits an 8<sub>&#8857;</sub> black hole every 20 days. To speed up the models, we will model stars at the sub-solar metallicity <var>Z</var> = 0.006 (similar to the metallicity in the Large Magellanic Cloud). 
</p>

<p class='lead'>
  <span class='font-weight-bold text-primary'>Task 1: Prepare your Model</span> Start with downloading the folders called <code>minilab1</code> and <code>ZAMS_models</code>. Update the initial masses and initial period of the two stars in <code>inlist_project</code>. Locate the 12 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> zero-age main sequence model in the <code>ZAMS_model</code> folder and make sure your simulation will use it to start from. You should also update <code>inlist1</code> to reflect that this starting model uses a different metallicity than the default in <code>MESA</code>. Compile and run the code.

      <samp>MESA</samp> Warning: Low Resolution Runs
    </h5>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      The process of determining the correct mass transfer rate in a binary run is an iterative process. Essentially, the solver guesses a mass transfer rate and then checks to see if the donor star has receded within its roche lobe. It then tries to find the "right" mass transfer rate to get the final radius within some tolerance of the roche lobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make these runs go more quickly, we have lowered this tolerance, as well as the general spatial and temporal tolerances of the donor star model. A more science-ready exploration should investigate if these tolerances are sufficient for robust results (they likely aren't).

<h4 id='part1d' class='mt-4'>Updating the Wind Mass-Loss Rate</h4>
<p>
  The default wind mass-loss rate for stripped stars in <code>MESA</code> is an extrapolation of the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26A...360..227N/abstract" target=_blank>Nugis & Lamers (2000)</a> empirical wind mass-loss recipe created from a sample of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. This extrapolation reproduces relatively accurately the wind mass loss rate from the only published intermediate mass stripped star, the &#8776;4 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> quasi-WR star in the binary HD 45166 (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...485..245G/abstract" target=_blank>Groh et al., 2008</a>). However, a recent theoretical model from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...607L...8V/abstract" target=_blank>Vink (2017)</a> predicts that the wind mass loss rate from intermediate mass stripped stars should be significantly lower. This, because WR stars are so bright that radiation pressure contributes to the wind mass-loss, while it should be unimportant for intermediate mass stripped stars, which are less luminous. As a result, Vink (2017) proposed that the wind mass-loss rate from stripped stars is related to the luminosity and metallicity following the relation:
</p>
<p>
  \[\log\dot{M} = -13.3 + 1.36\log\left(L/L_\odot\right) + 0.61\log\left(Z/Z_\odot\right)\]
</p>
<p>
  If stellar winds are strong, they can significantly alter the stellar properties of a star, revealing deeper, chemically enriched layers. For stripped stars, the amount of hydrogen left over after mass transfer not only affects the stellar properties, but also the possibility to interact again and the supernova type (see <a href="#part2">minilab 2</a>). 
</p>
<p class='lead'>
  <span class='font-weight-bold text-primary'>Task 3: Implement a Custom Wind</span> Make a copy of your first work directory that you used for the first two tasks. In the new directory, implement the Vink (2017) wind mass loss rate for stripped stars with mass <10 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> in the run_star_extras.f90 file and activate the <code>other_wind</code> hook. Note that we have prepared a function into which you can implement the new wind mass loss scheme.

      Usually, to implement the <code>other_wind</code> hook, you need to write your own subroutine to actually compute the wind (pursuant to a particular signature found in <code>$MESA_DIR/star/other/other_wind.f90</code>). However, we've already done <em>most</em> of that for you here. Look inside <code>src/run_star_extras.f90</code> and see if you can find the routine that computes the windfor our stellar model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've found the routine, edit it so that the Vink (2017) routine (also already defined within this subroutine) fires for stars with masses less than 10 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> (there's a particular variable whose value you'll want to update).

        <li>Point <code>s% other_wind</code> to the routine that should set the wind (in <code>extras_controls</code> within <code>run_star_extras.f90</code>)</li>
        <li>Ensure that a line (not shown here) is added to the <code>controls</code> namelist of the star you want to use the wind routine that tells it to use the other wind</li>

<p>
  As we saw before, this star is not typical for its mass. It is <em>much</em> smaller and hotter than would be expected of a comparable ZAMS star. In fact, this stripped star is so hot that it emits hydrogen-ionizing radiation at high rates. Unlike main-sequence stars and sometimes even Wolf-Rayet stars, the emission rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons from this intermediate mass stripped star can be approximated with a Planck curve (blackbody radiation). Let's use this approximation to visualize the change in flux of hydrogen-ionizing photons as our this model is stripped.
</p>
<p class='lead'>
  <span class='font-weight-bold text-primary'>Task 4: Track Ionizing Radiation</span> Identify the subroutine defined in <code>src/run_star_extras.f90</code> that computes the emission rate of H-ionizing photons, <var>Q</var><sub>0</sub>. Use this subroutine to add the quantity log<sub>10</sub><var>Q</var><sub>0</sub> as a column in star 1's <code>history.data</code> file called <code>log10_Q0</code>. Then, show the extra panel in the pgstar dashboard (the code is already in the <code>&pgstar</code> namelist in <code>inlist1</code>; you only need to activate the panel). Compile and re-run your model.

<h4 id='part2b' class='mt-4'>Limiting Black Hole Growth</h4>
<p>
  We are forgetting that the accretor is a black hole! Black holes cannot accrete at infinite rates, but their mass accretion rates are thought to be limited by the so-called Eddington accretion rate. When the accretion rate reaches the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure produced by the accretion is so strong that it can prevent accretion. 
</p>

<p>
  If mass accretion is not fully conservative, some material will be lost from the system, and it leaves with some angular momentum, which can affect the binary orbit. If the material is thought to be flung out after spending some time with the accreting star, it is thought to leave with the specific angular momentum equal to that of the accreting star - a process called isotropic re-emission.

  <span class='font-weight-bold text-primary'>Task 1: Limiting Retention</span> Search <code>$MESA_DIR/binary/defaults/binary_controls.defaults</code> for an inlist option that will limit the mass accretion rate onto the black hole by the eddington accretion rate. Activate that control and re-run the model. Use the results to answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul class='lead'>
  <li>Is the accretion efficient? That is, is 100% of the mass lost by the donor accreted by the black hole? If not, estimate the quantity <var>β</var> = <var>M&#775;</var><sub>acc</sub>/<var>M&#775;</var><sub>trans</sub>.</li>
  <li>What was the final orbital period after mass transfer? Compare to this orbital period to what we found before. Does this result make sense?</li>

      To determine if the mass transfer is efficient, we should look at the combined mass of the binary. If it is always 20 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> (since we started with a 12 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> star and an 8 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> black hole). Compare the top history panels from the pgstar dashboard before and after adding this control:

      As we can see, applying the eddington limit scheme results in <strong>nonconservative mass transfer</strong>, as evidenced by apparently constant black hole mass while the donor loses mass. 
    </p>

    <p class='card-text'>
      We can estimate <var>β</var> by computing the change in mass of the black hole and dividing it by the magnitude of the change in mass of the donor star. From the last lines of data in the terminal output, we can find the final value of <var>M</var><sub>1</sub> is 4.390338 M<sub>&#8857;</sub>, while the final mass of the black hole, <var>M</var><sub>2</sub>, is 8.007592 M\<sub>&#8857;</sub>. Their starting masses were 12 M<sub>&#8857;</sub> and 8 M<sub>&#8857;</sub>, respectively. Thus, the mass retention efficiency is
    </p>
    \[\beta = \frac{M_{2,f} - M_{2,i}}{\left\vert M_{1,f} - M_{1,i}\right\vert} = \frac{8.007592\,M_\odot - 8.000000\,M_\odot}{\left\vert 4.390338\,M_\odot - 12.000000\,M_\odot\right\vert} = 0.000998 \approx 0.1\%\]
    <p class='card-text'>
      The final orbital period is approximately 57.8 days, which is larger than what we found when we didn't limit the accretion rate. This might be surprising since this simulation lost more angular momentum due to nonconservative mass transfer, but remember that the decreased mass of the system itself means a decreased angular momentum even if the period may have increased somewhat.

<h4 id='part2c' class='mt-4'>Supernova Classification</h4>
<p>
  The detection of only one intermediate mass stripped star has been published. It is called a "quasi Wolf Rayet star" and is part of the binary system HD 45166 (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...485..245G/abstract" target=_blank>Groh et al., 2008</a>). Even though stripped stars themselves appear rare or are rather difficult to locate, many supernovae thought to result from the collapse of stripped stars have been identified. These stripped-envelope supernovae are, unsurprisingly, hydrogen-poor and constitute about a third of all core-collapse supernovae (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.1522S/abstract" target=_blank>Smith et al., 2011</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...837..120G/abstract" target=_blank>Graur et al., 2017a</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...837..121G/abstract" target=_blank>Graur et al., 2017b</a>). 
</p>
<p>
  There are three main classes of stripped-envelope supernovae, distinguished by how much hydrogen or helium they contain. Following Hachinger et al. (2012), we make the following distinction: 
</p>
<dl class="row" id='sn_types'>
  <dt class='col-2'>Type IIb</dt>
  <dd class='col-10'>Hydrogen-poor (> 0.03 M<sub>&#8857;</sub>), helium-rich</dd>
  <dt class='col-2'>Type Ib</dt>
  <dd class='col-10'>Hydrogen-free (<a href="#sn-types" title="But Dessart et al. (2012) found that this limit could be as low as 0.001 M<sub>&#8857;</sub>" data-toggle='tooltip' data-html='true' data-placement='top'>< 0.02 M<sub>&#8857;</sub></a>), helium-rich (> 0.14 M<sub>&#8857;</sub>)</dd>
  <dt class='col-2'>Type Ic</dt>
  <dd class='col-10'>Hydrogen-free (< 0.02 M<sub>&#8857;</sub>), helium-free (< 0.06 M<sub>&#8857;</sub>)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  As this list shows, the amount of leftover hydrogen at explosion is an important determinant for the supernova type. In this lab, we will explore how much hydrogen is left on the surface of stripped stars and what its effect is, not the least for what supernova the star produces.
