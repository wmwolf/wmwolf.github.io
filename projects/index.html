<h2> Coding Projects</h2>
In the process of working with the 1D stellar evolution code 
<a href=http://mesa.sourceforge.net>MESA</a> (Modules for Experiments in
Stellar Astrophysics), I've written several helper utilites to more easily
access data and to ease the process of starting MESA projects, installing and 
updating MESA, and other little tasks. All of these are open source projects
hosted on GitHub.

<h3> MesaReader </h3>
<p> MesaReader is a tool for accessing data in MESA output files for use in 
analysis and plotting. Versions are available for 
<a href=http://wmwolf.github.io/py_mesa_reader>Python</a> (intended to work
with <a href=http://www.numpy.org/>NumPy</a> and <a href=http://matplotlib.org>Matplotlib</a>) and <a href=http://wmwolf.github.io/MESA_Reader>Ruby
</a> (intended to work with <a href=http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/members/PM/paxton/tioga.html>Tioga</a>).</p>

<h3> MesaScript </h3>
<p> <a href=http://wmwolf.github.io/MesaScript>MesaScript</a> is a DSL (Domain
Specific Language) for creating inlists in MESA. Inlists are typically static
input files that do not allow for the use of variables, conditional statements,
loops, or other niceties of computer languages. MesaScript gives inlists a more
flexible, declarative syntax while sprinkling in the full power of the Ruby
programming language, allowing for the automated creation of complex inlists.
It's perfect for parameter space studies where large numbers of inlists must
be created where only a few parameters change.</p>

<h3> MESA Command Line Tools </h3>
<p> MESA command line tools, or <a href=http://wmwolf.github.io/mesa_cli> 
mesa_cli</a>, is, as you may guess, a command line tool that does various
tasks associated with working with MESA. This tool is currently under 
development, but as of the last update to this site, it implements the
following features via simple, one-line commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determines current MESA version number</li>
  <li>Summoning defaults files for different namelists</li>
  <li>Installing a new version of MESA, updating login scripts (bash only)</li>
  <li>Creation of a fresh work directory with a new name and optional
  MesaScript file</li>
  <li>Copying of test suite cases with "de-test-suitification"</li>
  <li>"Pointing" of general inlists named "inlist" to specific inlists</li>
</ul>
<p>
Planned development will add installation functionality to c shell users as 
well. Other feature requests are welcome!
</p>

<h2> Course Notes </h2>
<p>After getting sick of taking bad hand-written notes for long enough, I
decided to start bringing my laptop to my graduate courses to typeset my notes 
on the fly. As it turns out, other students were interested in having access 
to those notes, so they are now available on github as well.
</p>
<p>
Most of these notes are not sufficiently proof-read and lack figures that
were drawin in the class, so they are not considered complete with the possible
exception of the notes for PHYS 232: Stellar Structure, which I sat through 
twice. Notes are available for the following astrophysics graduate courses:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/wmwolf/232-Notes>PHYS 232: Stellar Structure
   and Evolution</a></li>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/wmwolf/233-Notes>PHYS 233: Interstellar Medium
    </a></li>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/wmwolf/234-Notes>PHYS 234: High Energy 
  Astrophysics</a></li>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/wmwolf/236-Notes>PHYS 236: Cosmology</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
I also took notes for two of the undergraduate courses I was a teaching assistant for. These, too, have not been fully vetted and should be considered
incomplete. Still, you may find them useful.
