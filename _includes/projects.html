    <h2> Coding Projects</h2>
    <p>
      In the process of working with the 1D stellar evolution code
      <a href=http://mesa.sourceforge.net>MESA</a> (Modules for Experiments in
      Stellar Astrophysics), I've written several helper utilites to more
      easily access data and to ease the process of starting MESA projects,
      installing and updating MESA, and other little tasks. All of these are
      open source projects hosted on GitHub.

    <h4> MesaReader </h4>
    <p> 
      MesaReader is a tool for accessing data in MESA output files for use 
      in analysis and plotting. Versions are available for 
      <a href=http://wmwolf.github.io/py_mesa_reader>
        Python
      </a>
      (intended to work with
      <a href=http://www.numpy.org/>NumPy</a> 
      and 
      <a href=http://matplotlib.org>Matplotlib</a>) and 
      <a href=http://wmwolf.github.io/MESA_Reader>Ruby</a>
      (intended to work with 
      <a href=http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/members/PM/paxton/tioga.html>
      Tioga</a>).
    </p>
    <h4> MesaScript </h4>
    <p> 
      <a href=http://wmwolf.github.io/MesaScript>MesaScript</a> is a DSL 
      (Domain Specific Language) for creating inlists in MESA. Inlists are
      typically static input files that do not allow for the use of
      variables, conditional statements, loops, or other niceties of computer
      languages. MesaScript gives inlists a more flexible, declarative syntax
      while sprinkling in the full power of the Ruby programming language,
      allowing for the automated creation of complex inlists. It's perfect
      for parameter space studies where large numbers of inlists must be
      created where only a few parameters change.

    <h4> MESA Command Line Tools </h4>
    <p>
      MESA command line tools, or
      <a href=http://wmwolf.github.io/mesa_cli>mesa_cli</a>,
      is, as you may guess, a command line tool that does various tasks
      associated with working with MESA. This tool is currently under
      development, but as of the last update to this site, it implements the
      following features via simple, one-line commands:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determines current MESA version number</li>
      <li>Summoning defaults files for different namelists</li>
      <li>Installing a new version of MESA, updating login scripts (bash only)</li>
      <li>Creation of a fresh work directory with a new name and optional
      MesaScript file</li>
      <li>Copying of test suite cases with "de-test-suitification"</li>
      <li>"Pointing" of general inlists named "inlist" to specific inlists</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Planned development will add installation functionality to c shell
      users as well. Other feature requests are welcome!

    <h2> Course Notes </h2>
    <p>
      After getting sick of taking bad hand-written notes for long enough,
      I decided to start bringing my laptop to my graduate courses to 
      typeset my notes on the fly. As it turns out, other students were 
      interested in having access to those notes, so they are now available
      on github as well.

    <h4>Graduate Astrophysics</h4>
    <p>
      Most of these notes are not sufficiently proof-read and lack figures
      that were drawin in the class, so they are not considered complete with
      the possible exception of the notes for PHYS 232: Stellar Structure,
      which I sat through twice. Notes are available for the following
      astrophysics graduate courses:

    <h4> Undergraduate Astrophysics </h4>
    <p>
      I also took notes for two of the undergraduate courses I was a teaching
      assistant for. These, too, have not been fully vetted and should be
      considered incomplete. Still, you may find them useful.
