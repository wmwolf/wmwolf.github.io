# Inelastic Collisons II
On a frictionless surface, a sliding box collides and sticks to a second identical box that is initially at rest. What is the final $K_i$ of the system in terms of the initial kinetic energy, $K_f$?

## Options
- $K_f = K_i$
- $K_f = \\frac{1}{4}K_i$
- $K_f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}K_i$
- *$K_f = \\frac{1}{2}K_i$
- $K_f = \\sqrt{2}K_i$

## Explanations
- Before we found that after the collision, velocity was halved. But we now have twice tha mass. Use the definition of kinetic energy, $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ to compare the initial and final kinetic energies.
- The velocity being reduced to half would on its own cause the kinetic energy to be quartered, but don't forget that the mass is now doubled!

- Yes! Doubling the mass on its own would double the kinetic energy, but since we are also halving the speed (which would reduce the kinetic energy by a factor of 2<sup>2</sup> = 4), the overall effect is to reduce the kinetic energy by a factor of 2.
