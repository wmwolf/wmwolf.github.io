# Crash Cars I
If all three collisions to the right are <b>totally inelastic</b>, which one(s) will bring the car on the left to a complete halt? You may assume the brick wall to have effectively infinite mass; the car cannot move it.

## Options
- Case I
- Case II
- Case III
- Cases II and III
- *All three

## Explanations
- This situation will indeed stop the car, but it is not the only one.
- This situation will indeed stop the car, but it is not the only one.
- This situation will indeed stop the car, but it is not the only one.
- Indeed, both of these will stop the car, but since the brick wall cannot be moved <emph>and</emph> the car and brick wall must move with the same velocity after the crash, Case I must also stop the car on the left.
- Yes! In case I, the brick wall cannot be moved, so by definition, an inelastic collision with the brick wall will require both the car and the wall to be at rest after the collision. In cases II and III, the opposing vehicle has equal and opposite momentum, so the total momentum is zero, and if both vehicles are to have the same speed after the crash, the only viable speed is zero.
