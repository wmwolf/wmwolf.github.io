# Limits of the Kinematic Equations
When do the kinematic equations not apply?

## Options
- Motion in more than one dimension.
- *Motion with variable acceleration.
- Motion with variable velocity.
- It holds in all three scenarios.

## Explanations
- Though we may not have covered it yet, we can use the kinematic equations in multiple dimensions to describe projectile motion.
- Yes! The very first step of the derivation of the kinematic equations assumed constant acceleration.
- No. Kinematics can account for changing velocities, like an object falling under the influence of uniform gravity.
- No, there is at least one base assumption of the kinematic equations that, if violated, makes them incorrect.
