# Tossing a Ball
You throw a ball straight up in the air. It rises for a time before falling back to your hand. Describe how the <span class='font-italic'>velocity</span> changes from the instant it left your hand to the instant just before it returns.

## Options
- *It starts positive and decreases through zero and ends negative.
- It is constant through the entire trajectory.
- It rises initially until peak height, and then decreases.
- It is always non-negative but decreasing.

## Explanations
- Yes! You start the ball off with a positive (upwards) velocity initially, but gravity's constant pull causes it to slow down, stop mid-air, and then move downwards (negative velocity) back to your hand.
- Not quite... The velocity is how the position changes with time. If you took snapshots at equal time intervals, would the ball appear to move the same amount in the same direction between every pair of snapshots?
- Hint: you might be thinking of the <span class="font-italic">position</span> rather than the <span class="font-italic">velocity</span>
- Gravity does cause the velocity to decrease, but if the velocity is always non-negative, then the ball would always be moving upward (or at least never downwards).
