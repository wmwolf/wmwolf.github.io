# Constant Velocity
An object moves with constant, positive velocity. Which of these is true of its acceleration and displacement?

## Options
- Acceleration is positive, displacement increasing
- *Acceleration is zero, displacement increasing
- Acceleration is positive, displacement is constant
- Acceleration is zero, displacement is constant

## Explanations
- What is the relationship between acceleration and velocity? What does it mean for velocity to be constant?
- Yes! A constant velocity means acceleration vanishes, but the positive velocity means that the object is constantly moving forward (or up, or whatever positive means).
- What is the relationship between acceleration and velocity? What does it mean for velocity to be constant? Also, what does a non-zero velocity mean for the displacement?
- A constant velocity does indeed mean the acceleration is zero, but what does a non-zero velocity mean for the displacement? The object is not at rest.
