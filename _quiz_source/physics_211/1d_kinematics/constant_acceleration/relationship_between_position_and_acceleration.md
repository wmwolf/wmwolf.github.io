# Relationship Between Position and Acceleration
Which of these statements is true of displacement and acceleration?

## Options
- There is no direct link between displacement and acceleration.
- Displacement is the first derivative with respect to time of acceleration.
- Acceleration is the integral of displacement over time.
- *Acceleration is the second derivative with respect to time of displacement.

## Explanations
- There is a relationship between the two. It might be easier to think of velocity as an intermediate quantity that relates the two together.
- Maybe think of the units. Every time we differentiate something with respect to time, the units of that quantity have on more time dimension. In SI, acceleration has units of m/s<sup>2</sup>.

- Yes! Acceleration is the first derivative of velocity, which is in turn the first derivative of displacement, so acceleration is the second derivative of displacement.
