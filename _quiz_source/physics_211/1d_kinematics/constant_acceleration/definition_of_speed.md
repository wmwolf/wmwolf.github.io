# Definition of Speed
"Speed" is most accurately described as...

## Options
- a vector
- a vector but it cannot be negative
- a scalar
- *a scalar but it cannot be negative

## Explanations
- No... perhaps you are thinking of <span class="font-italic">velocity</span>?
- Not quite. Does it make sense for a vector to "always be positive or negative"? Vectors are just pairs of values and directions. What is "negative" is determined by our coordinate system.
- Close, it is a scalar, but we can be more precise.
- Yes! Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. As such, it must <span class="font-italic">always</span> be non-negative. Not all scalars are non-negative, though. For example, temperature (in some scales) can be negative.
